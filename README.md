# WebROVER for Restaurants

## Objective
The objective of this project is to enhance restaurant service by automating food delivery through a robot. The robot will navigate autonomously to deliver food to customer-selected tables, improving both efficiency and customer satisfaction.  

The restaurant manager will interact with a web interface to choose the table number. The robot, equipped with a preloaded map of the restaurant, will use this input to navigate accurately to the designated table. This system aims to:  
- Reduce dependency on human waitstaff  
- Minimize service delays  
- Streamline operations  
- Provide a more efficient and consistent dining experience  

## Proposed Method
This project aims to develop an autonomous food delivery robot for restaurants, integrating **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**, autonomous navigation, and a web-based control interface.  

### Workflow:
1. The restaurant manager will use a webpage displaying table numbers.  
2. Upon selecting a table number, the robot will navigate to the specified position.  
3. The robot will use its preloaded map of the restaurant to identify the tableâ€™s location.  
4. The robot will autonomously navigate while avoiding obstacles.  
5. Food placed on the tray attached to the robot will be delivered to the selected table.  

## Core Features
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Simple table selection for non-technical users.  
- **Autonomous Operation**: No need for human intervention in routine food delivery.  
- **Efficient Navigation**: Utilizes **SLAM** and path planning for accurate delivery.  
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted for larger restaurant setups with multiple robots.  

## Technologies Used
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** for real-time positioning  
- **Path Planning Algorithms** for efficient movement  
- **Web Interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** for user interaction  
- **Microcontrollers/Sensors** for navigation and obstacle avoidance  

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with restaurant POS (Point of Sale) systems  
- Voice and touchscreen commands for direct customer interaction  
- Multi-robot coordination for large-scale restaurants
